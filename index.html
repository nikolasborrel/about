    Software Engineer, Meta Reality Labs (Redmond, US).

    <h2>PhD research interests: Virtual acoustics</h2>
    <a name="research_interests"></a>
    I am concerned with developing accurate and efficient methods for simulating room acoustics in dynamic scenes with
    parametric source/receiver positions. Applications are in computer games, virtual and augmented reality, such as
    spatial computing and metaverses. The focus is on traditional numerical methods and scientific machine learning
    methods for solving the underlying physics, implicitly taking wave phenomena into account.

    <h2>Algorithmic composition</h2>
    I have a profound interest in algorithmic composition, such as data-driven music creation and harmonization.
    Previously, I developed a method for harmonizing rhythmic music, and it uses a hidden Markov model to learn
    harmonizations of different artists in different genres and allows new chord sequences to be generated for a given
    melody.
