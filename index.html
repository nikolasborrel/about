<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<a name="research_interests"></a>

<h3>Virtual acoustics</h3>
My primary research theme is in the field of Virtual Acoustics (how to simulate acoustics in virtual buildings and room). This includes developing and implementing numerical methods for solving the physical equations describing the wave behavior and boundary conditions corresponding to those arising in the real world. The focus is on efficient and accurate methods, suitable for massive parallel architectures (e.g. GPUs).

<p>
Currently, I am researching topics within the following areas

<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method" target="_blank">SEM/DG-FEM</a>
    <li> <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/doctorates/desmet.pdf" target="_blank">WBM (Wave-based method)</a>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_decomposition_methods" target="_blank">Domain decomposition methods</a>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithmic composition</h3>
In addition, I have a profound interest in algorithmic composition, such as data-driven music creation and harmonization. Previously, I developed a method for harmonising rhythmic music. It uses a hidden Markov model to learn harmonisations of different artists in different genres and allows new chord sequences to be generated with respect to a given melody.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<a name="teaching"></a>
I would be happy to co-supervise projects within the topic of Virtual Acoustics. The following list can be used as inspiration:

<ul>
    <li> <b>Automatic hybridization of wave-based and geometrical acoustics simulations</b>
        <p>
        Wave-based simulation methods (FEM etc) are highly accurate methods, but they are computationally very heavy and therefore mainly restricted to low/mid frequency simulations. Therefore, a good approach is to combine wave-based methods for the low and mid frequency portion of the spectrum (where most of the wave phenomena happens) and geometrical acoustics simulation methods for the high frequencies (where the geometrical acoustics assumption is fair).
    <li> <b>Listening tests</b>
        <p>
        We are planning some listening tests to find the right perceptual thresholds in virtual acoustics. E.g. how much resolution do we need in the simulation? How accurately do we have to model the geometry? What is the appropriate crossover frequency between wave-based and geometrical simulations?
    <li> <b>Automatic simplification and setup of architectural models for acoustic simulations. </b>
        <p>
        This is a very practical topic - but when you dig into the details there are several highly scientific challenges involved. It's a very important topic. Acoustician spend a huge amount of time remodeling architectural models such that they are suitable for acoustic simulations. Doing the relevant simplifications that make the computations feasible but don't degrade the acoustical accuracy. Exporting / importing models etc. It could be groundbreaking if we could automatically go from complex architectural models to the acoustic models. Integrate the simulators as plug-ins into the architectural drawing software.
    <li> <b>Spatial sound aspects in wave-based simulations.</b>
        <p>
        This refers to developing methods to account for the directivity of sound sources in wave-based simulation methods. Furthermore, to account for directive (binaural / ambisonics) receivers.
    <li> <b>Real-time convolution and other improvements of our acoustic virtual reality system.</b>
        <p>
        We have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106553" target="_blank">developed an AVR system</a> that allows us to take pre-computed simulation results and experience them in VR. This allows us to couple sound to the visual models, walk around the model and switch between different design options on the fly. The system is very memory intensive because we pre-convolve all of the anechoic sounds with the impulse responses. It would be much more efficient to compute the convolutions on the fly and probably ways for compressing the IRs will needed. Another aspect could be to improve the way we interpolate between different pre-computed IRs on the grid, e.g. using Gaussian regression or other machine learning based methods.
    <li> <b>Accurate modeling of membrane absorbers and other vibrating airtight surfaces in wave-based simulations.</b>
        <p>
        The acoustic properties of room surfaces have a huge influence on the acoustics of spaces and it is very important to model these properties as accurately as possible. One class of absorbers where we could improve our boundary modeling is membrane absorbers (e.g. gypsum walls, membrane bass traps etc). This involves coupling the air domain simulation with a vibro-acoustics simulation of the vibrating surface.
    <li> <b>Uncertainty quantification of virtual acoustic simulations.</b>
        <p>
        We recently carried out a MSc project on this topic involving an analysis of the uncertainty in the model caused by the model inputs (boundary conditions, model geometry etc). This is hugely helpful because it gives insights into when the models can be assumed to be accurate and when not.
    <li> <b>Numerical improvements.</b>
        <p>
        This one is perhaps a bit too technical, but there are aspects on the numerical side that can be improved as well. Local time stepping, variable order simulation, adaptive meshing etc.
