<h2>Research interests</h2>
<a name="research_interests"></a>

<h3>PhD research topic: Virtual acoustics</h3>
I am concerned with developing accurate and efficient methods for simulating room acoustics in dynamic scenes with moving sources/receivers and flexible geometries. Applications are in computer games, mixed reality, and building design. The focus is on traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods for solving the underlying physics, implicitly taking wave phenomena into account.

    <li> Accelerating sound propagation in realistic 3D scenes with parameterized sources using deep neural operators. To be submitted in May 2023.
    <li> A sensitivity analysis on the effect of hyperparameters in deep neural operators applied to sound propagation. To be presentated at a conference in 2023.

</ul>

<h3>Other interests: Algorithmic composition</h3>
I have a profound interest in algorithmic composition, such as data-driven music creation and harmonization. Previously, I developed a method for harmonizing rhythmic music, and it uses a hidden Markov model to learn harmonizations of different artists in different genres and allows new chord sequences to be generated for a given melody.
