<h2>Research interests</h2>
<a name="research_interests"></a>

<h3>PhD research topic: Virtual acoustics</h3>
I am concerned with developing accurate and efficient methods for simulating room acoustics in dynamic scenes with moving sources/receivers and flexible geometries. Applications are in computer games, mixed reality, and building design. The focus is on traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods for solving the underlying physics, implicitly taking wave phenomena into account.

<p>
Currently, I am researching topics within the following areas

<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11313" target="_blank">Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Sound Field Predictions with Parameterized Sources and Impedance Boundaries</a>
    <li> SEM/DG-FEM
    <li> <em>The</em> Wave-Based Method (WBM)</a>
    <li> Domain decomposition methods</a>
</ul>

<h3>Other interests: Algorithmic composition</h3>
I have a profound interest in algorithmic composition, such as data-driven music creation and harmonization. Previously, I developed a method for harmonizing rhythmic music, and it uses a hidden Markov model to learn harmonizations of different artists in different genres and allows new chord sequences to be generated for a given melody.
